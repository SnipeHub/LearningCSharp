Escaping sequences are literals.They are a sequence of special characters,
which describe a character that cannot be written directly in the source code.
This is, for instance, the “new line” character.
There are many examples of characters that cannot be represented directly in
the source code: a double quotation mark, tab, new line, backslash and
others.Here are some of the most frequently used escaping sequences:
- \' – single quote
- \" – double quotes
- \\ – backslash
- \n – new line
- \t – offset(tab)
- \uXXXX – char specified by its Unicode number, for example \u03A7.
The character \ (backslash) is also called an escaping character because it
allows the display on screen (or other output device) of characters that have
special meaning or effect and cannot be represented directly in the source
code.
