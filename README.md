Currently starting with this book. Free of cost, its a little old from Dec 2013, but is still relevent. It teaches you the fundamentals of Programming while using C#. In other words it explains everything about the language so you get a good grasp on how it works. Rather than diving in and not undertanding what the heck you are doing, you will have have some, hopefully, somewhat planted feet when you are done. I am a few hours into the book, and have just finished chapter 1. So far I am glad I have gone this route. It has explained alot of questions that I had left unanswered. When I tried to learn C# just by jumping into it, a lot of books fail to mention the full details behind the why! I highly recommend this book for beginners. Once this is done, you will be able to start a real beginner C# book and jump into the code without too much trouble.

    Once you have gone through the above book! The C# Player's Guide (3rd Edition) Paperback – March 13, 2016 by RB Whitaker (Author)
