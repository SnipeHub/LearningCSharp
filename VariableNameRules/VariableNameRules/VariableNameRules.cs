// Naming Variables

// Variable names can contain the letters a-z, A-Z, the digits 0-9 as well as the character '_'

// Variable names cannot start with a digit

// Variable names cannot coincide with a keyword of the C# language.
//For example, base , char , default , int , object , this , null and many
//others cannot be used as variable names.

// If you want to name a variable like a keyword, we can add a prefix to the name - "@".
//For example, @char and @null are valid variable names while char and null are invalid.
